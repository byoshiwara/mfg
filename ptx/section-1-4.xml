<subsection><title>Using Ratios for Comparison</title>

<p>Which is more expensive, a 64-ounce bottle of Velvolux dish soap that costs $3.52, or a 60-ounce bottle of Rainfresh dish soap that costs $3.36?</p>
<p>You are probably familiar with the notion of comparison shopping. To decide which dish soap is the better buy, we compute the unit price, or price per ounce, for each bottle. The unit price for Velvolux is
    <me>\frac{352 \text{ cents}}{64 \text{ ounces}}= 5.5 \text{ cents per ounce}</me>
and the unit price for Rainfresh is
    <me>\frac{336 \text{ cents}}{60 \text{ ounces}}= 5.6 \text{ cents per ounce}</me></p>

<p>The Velvolux costs less per ounce, so it is the better buy. By computing the price of each brand for <em>the same amount of soap</em>, it is easy to compare them.</p>

<p>In many situations, a ratio, similar to a unit price, can provide a basis for comparison. <xref ref="example-rate-of-growth" text="type-global" /> uses a ratio to measure a rate of growth.</p>

<example xml:id="example-rate-of-growth"><statement>
    <p>Which grow faster, Hybrid A wheat seedlings, which grow 11.2 centimeters in 14 days, or Hybrid B seedlings, which grow 13.5 centimeters in 18 days?</p></statement>
<solution><p>
    We compute the growth rate for each strain of wheat. Growth rate is expressed as a ratio, <m>\dfrac{\text{centimeters}}{\text{days}}</m>, or centimeters per day. The growth rate for Hybrid A is
    <me>\frac{11.2 \text{ centimeters}}{14 \text{ days}}= 0.8 \text{ centimeters per day}</me>
and the growth rate for Hybrid B is
    <me>\frac{13.5 \text{ centimeters}}{18 \text{ days}}= 0.75 \text{ centimeters per day}</me>
Because their rate of growth is larger, the Hybrid A seedlings grow faster.
</p></solution></example>

<p>By computing the growth of each strain of wheat seedling over the same unit of time, a single day, we have a basis for comparison. In this case, the ratio <m>\dfrac{\text{centimeters}}{\text{day}}</m> measures the rate of growth of the wheat seedlings.</p>

<subsection><title>Measuring Steepness</title>

<p component="main">In <xref ref="exercise-gas-mileage" text="type-global" />, the ratio <m>\dfrac{\text{miles}}{\text{gallon}}</m> measures the rate at which each car uses gasoline. By computing the mileage for each car for the same amount of gas, we have a basis for comparison. We can use this same idea, finding a common basis for comparison, to measure the steepness of an incline.</p>
<p component="webwork">In <xref ref="exercise-gas-mileagew" text="type-global" />, the ratio <m>\dfrac{\text{miles}}{\text{gallon}}</m> measures the rate at which each car uses gasoline. By computing the mileage for each car for the same amount of gas, we have a basis for comparison. We can use this same idea, finding a common basis for comparison, to measure the steepness of an incline.</p>

<p>Imagine you are an ant carrying a heavy burden along one of the two paths shown below. Which path is more difficult? Most ants would agree that the steeper path is more difficult. </p>

<sidebyside widths="50% 45%" valigns="middle middle"><p>But what exactly is steepness? It is not merely the gain in altitude, because even a gentle incline will reach a great height eventually. Steepness measures how sharply the altitude increases. An ant finds the second path more difficult, or steeper, because it rises 5 feet while the first path rises only 2 feet over the same horizontal distance.</p>
<image source="images/fig-ant-climb"><description>ant's climb</description></image></sidebyside>

<p>To compare the steepness of two inclined paths, we compute the ratio of change in altitude to change in horizontal distance for each path.</p>

<example xml:id="example-steep-trail"><statement><p>Which is steeper, Stony Point trail, which climbs 400 feet over a horizontal distance of 2500 feet, or Lone Pine trail, which climbs 360 feet over a horizontal distance of 1800 feet?</p></statement>

<solution><p>For each trail, we compute the ratio of vertical gain to horizontal distance. For Stony Point trail, the ratio is
    <me>\frac{400 \text{ feet}}{2500 \text{ feet}}= 0.16 </me>  
and for Lone Pine trail, the ratio is
    <me>\frac{360 \text{ feet}}{1800 \text{ feet}}= 0.20 </me> 
Lone Pine trail is steeper, because it has a vertical gain of 0.20 foot for every foot traveled horizontally. Or, in more practical units, Lone Pine trail rises 20 feet for every 100 feet of horizontal distance, whereas Stony Point trail rises only 16 feet over a horizontal distance of 100 feet.</p></solution></example>

<subsection><title>Definition of Slope</title>

<p>To compare the steepness of the two trails in <xref ref="example-steep-trail" text="type-global" />, it is not enough to know which trail has the greater gain in elevation overall. Instead, we compare their elevation gains <em>over the same horizontal distance.</em> Using the same horizontal distance provides a basis for comparison. The two trails are illustrated below as lines on a coordinate grid.</p>    
    <image width="70%" source="images/fig-trail-climb-grid"><description>trails on grid</description></image>

<p>The ratio we computed in <xref ref="example-steep-trail" text="type-global" />,
    <me>\frac{\text{change in elevation}}{\text{change in horizontal position}}</me>  
appears on the graphs as
    <me>\frac{\text{change in }y\text{-coordinate}}{\text{change in }x\text{-coordinate}}</me> 
For example, as we travel along the line representing Stony Point trail, we move from the point <m>(0, 0)</m> to the point <m>(2500, 400)</m>. The <m>y</m>-coordinate changes by <m>400</m> and the <m>x</m>-coordinate changes by <m>2500</m>, giving the ratio <m>0.16</m> that we found in <xref ref="example-steep-trail" text="type-global" />. We call this ratio the <term>slope</term> of the line.</p>

<assemblage><title>Definition of Slope</title>
    <p>The <term>slope</term><idx>slope</idx> of a line is the ratio
    <me>\frac{\text{change in }y\text{-coordinate}}{\text{change in }x\text{-coordinate}}</me>

<solution><p>As we move along the line from <m>A</m> to <m>B</m>, the <m>y</m>-coordinate changes by <m>3</m> units, and the <m>x</m>-coordinate changes by <m>4</m> units. The slope of the line is thus
    <me>\frac{\text{change in }y\text{-coordinate}}{\text{change in }x\text{-coordinate}}=\frac{3}{4}</me>

<note><p>The slope of a line is a <em>number</em>. It tells us how much the <m>y</m>-coordinates of points on the line increase when we increase their <m>x</m>-coordinates by 1 unit. For instance, the slope <m>\dfrac{3}{4}</m> in <xref ref="example-slope-grid" text="type-global" /> means that the <m>y</m>-coordinate increases by <m>\dfrac{3}{4}</m> unit when the <m>x</m>-coordinate increases by 1 unit. For increasing graphs, a larger slope indicates a greater increase in altitude, and hence a steeper line.

<subsection><title>Notation for Slope</title>

<p>We use a shorthand notation for the ratio that defines slope,
    <me>\frac{\text{change in }y\text{-coordinate}}{\text{change in }x\text{-coordinate}}</me> 
The symbol <m>\Delta</m> (the Greek letter delta) is used in mathematics to denote <em>change in</em>. In particular, <m>\Delta y</m> means <em>change in <m>y</m>-coordinate</em>, and <m>\Delta x</m> means <em>change in <m>x</m>-coordinate</em>. We also use the letter <m>m</m> to stand for slope. With these symbols, we can write the definition of slope as follows.</p>

<subsection><title>Meaning of Slope</title>

<sidebyside widths="50% 35%" valigns="middle middle">
<p>In <xref ref="example-Annelise" text="phrase-hybrid"/>, we graphed the equation <m>C = 5 + 3t</m> showing the cost of a bicycle rental in terms of the length of the rental. The graph is reproduced at right. We can choose any two points on the line to compute its slope. Using points <m>P</m> and <m>Q</m> as shown, we find that
    <me>m = \frac{\Delta C}{\Delta t}= \frac{9}{3}=3</me>
The slope of the line is <m>3</m>.</p>
<image source="images/fig-meaning-slope"><description>meaning of slope</description></image></sidebyside>

<p>What does this value mean for the cost of renting a bicycle? The expression
    <me>\frac{\Delta C}{\Delta t}= \frac{9}{3}</me>
stands for
    <me>\frac{\text{change in cost}}{\text{change in time}}= \frac{9 \text{ dollars }}{3 \text{ hours}}</me></p>

<p>If we increase the length of the rental by 3 hours, the cost of the rental increases by 9 dollars. The slope gives the <em>rate of increase</em> in the rental fee, 3 dollars per hour. In general, we can make the following statement.</p>

<assemblage><title>Rate of Change</title>
<p>The slope of a line measures the <term>rate of change</term><idx>rate of change</idx> of the output variable with respect to the input variable.</p>  </assemblage>

<p>Depending on the variables involved, this rate might be interpreted as a rate of growth or a rate of speed. A negative slope might represent a rate of decrease or a rate of consumption. The slope of a graph can give us valuable information about the variables.</p>

<subsection><title>A Formula for Slope</title>

<p>We have defined the slope of a line to be the ratio <m>m = \dfrac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}</m> as we move from one point to another on the line. So far, we have computed <m>\Delta y</m> and <m>\Delta x</m> by counting squares on the graph, but this method is not always practical. All we really need are the coordinates of two points on the graph.</p>

<assemblage><title>Subscripts</title>
<p>We will use <term>subscripts</term><idx>subscripts</idx> to distinguish the two points:
<me>P_1~~ \text{means "first point" and }~ P_2~~  \text{means "second point."}</me>
We denote the coordinates of <m>P_1</m> by <m>(x_1, y_1)</m> and the coordinates of <m>P_2</m> by <m>(x_2, y_2)</m>.
</p></assemblage>

<sidebyside widths="36% 50%" valigns="middle middle"><image source="images/fig-slope-formula"><description>slope of line</description></image>
<p>Now consider a specific example. The line through the two points <m>P_1 (2, 9)</m> and <m>P_2 (7,-6)</m> is shown at left. We can find <m>\Delta x</m> by subtracting the <m>x</m>-coordinates of the points: 
        <me>\Delta x = 7 - 2 = 5 </me>
In general, we have 
        <me>\Delta x = x_2 - x_1 </me>
and similarly
        <me>\Delta y = y_2 - y_1 </me>
    </p></sidebyside>

<p>These formulas work even if some of the coordinates are negative; in our example 
    <me>\Delta y = y_2 - y_1 = -6 - 9 = -15</me>
By counting squares <em>down</em> from <m>P_1</m> to <m>P_2</m>, we see that <m>\Delta y</m> is indeed <m>-15</m>. The slope of the line is 
           <me> m=\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}=\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} = \frac{-15}{5}  = -3</me>
 
We now have a formula for the slope of a line that works even if we do not have a graph.</p>

<assemblage><title>Two-Point Slope Formula</title>
<p>The slope of the line passing through the points <m>P_1 (x_1, y_1)</m> and <m>P_2 (x_2, y_2)</m> is given by
        <me>m = \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}= \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} \text{, if}~x_2 \ne x_1</me></p>
</assemblage>

<example xml:id="example-two-point-slope"><statement><p>Compute the slope of the line above using the points <m>Q_1 (6, -3)</m> and <m>Q_2 (4, 3)</m>. </p></statement>
<solution><p>We substitute the coordinates of <m>Q_1</m> and <m>Q_2</m> into the slope formula to find
        <me>m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}= \frac{3 - (-3)}{4 - 6} = \frac{6}{-2}= -3</me>
This value for the slope, <m>-3</m>, is the same value we found above.</p></solution></example>
