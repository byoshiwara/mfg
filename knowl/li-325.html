</h5>The graph begins just as the graph in part (a) does. But while Forrest waits for the bus, his distance from home remains constant, so the graph at that time is a horizontal line, as shown in <a knowl="./knowl/fig-home-to-school.html" knowl-id="xref-fig-home-to-school" alt="Figure 2.83 " title="Figure 2.83 ">Figure 2.83</a>b. The line has slope \(0\) because while Forrest is waiting for the bus, his speed is \(0\).
