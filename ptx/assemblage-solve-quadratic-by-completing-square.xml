    <p><ol marker="1.">
		<li><p><ol marker="a.">
			<li><p>Write the equation in standard form.</p></li>
			<li><p>Divide both sides of the equation by the coefficient of the quadratic term, and subtract the constant term from both sides.</p></li>
		</ol></p></li>
		<li><p>Complete the square on the left side:</p>
			<p><ol marker="a.">
				<li><p>Multiply the coefficient of the first-degree term by one-half, then square the result.</p></li>
				<li><p>Add the value obtained in (a) to both sides of the equation.</p></li>
			</ol></p></li>
		<li><p>Write the left side of the equation as the square of a binomial. Simplify the right side.</p></li>
		<li><p>Use extraction of roots to finish the solution.</p></li>
