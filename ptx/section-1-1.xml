<statement> <p>Delbert is offered a part-time job selling restaurant equipment. He will be paid $1000 per month plus a 6% commission on his sales. The sales manager tells Delbert he can expect to sell about $8000 worth of equipment per month. To help him decide whether to accept the job, Delbert does a few calculations.</p> 
    <p><ol>
        <li><p>Based on the sales manager’s estimate, what monthly income can Delbert expect from this job? What annual salary would that provide?</p></li>
        <li><p>What would Delbert’s monthly salary be if he sold only $5000 of equipment per month? What would his salary be if he sold $10,000 worth per month? Compute monthly incomes for each sales total shown in the table.</p>

    <subsection><title>Tables, Graphs and Equations</title>   
        <p>The first step in creating a model is to describe relationships between variables.  In <xref ref="investigation-commission" text="type-global" />, we analyzed the relationship between Delbert's sales and his income.  Starting from a verbal description, we represented the relationship in three different ways.</p>
            <p><ol>
                <li><p>A <term>table of values</term><idx>table of values</idx> displays specific data points with precise numerical values.</p></li>
                <li><p>A <term>graph</term><idx>graph</idx> is a visual display of the data.  It is easier to spot trends and describe the overall behavior of the variables from a graph.</p></li>
                <li><p>An <term>algebraic equation</term><idx>algebraic equation</idx> is a compact summary of the model.  It can be used to analyze the model and to make predictions</p></li>
            </ol></p>
                    
    <p>We begin our study of modeling with some examples of <term>linear models</term><idx>linear models</idx>.  In the examples that follow, observe the interplay among the three modeling tools, and how each contributes to the model.</p>
                    
<example xml:id="example-Annelise"><statement><p>Annelise is on vacation at a seaside resort.  She can rent a bicycle from her hotel for $3 an hour, plus a $5 insurance fee.  (A fraction of an hour is charged as the same fraction of $3.)</p><p><ol label="a">
    <li><p>Make a table of values showing the cost, <m>C</m>, of renting a bike for various lengths of time, <m>t</m>.</p></li>
    <li><p>Plot the points on a graph. Draw a curve through the data points.</p></li>
    <li><p>Write an equation for <m>C</m> in terms of <m>t</m>.</p></li></ol></p></statement>
                    
<solution><p><ol label="a">
    <li><p>To find the cost, we multiply the time by $3, and add the result to the $5 insurance fee.  For example, the cost of a 1-hour bike ride is
            <md><mrow>\text{Cost}\amp=(\$5\text{ insurance fee})+(\$3\text{ per hour})\times(\alert{1}\text{ hour})</mrow>

    For $18.50 Annelise can bicycle for 4½ hours. The point <m>Q</m> on the graph represents an $18.50 bike ride. The value on the <m>t</m>-axis below point <m>Q</m> is 4.5, so $18.50 will buy a 4.5 hour bike ride.</p>

<subsection><title>Linear Equations</title>
    <p>All the models in the preceding examples have equations with a similar form:  
        <me>\blert{y=\text{(starting value)}+\text{(rate of change)}\cdot x}</me>
(We'll talk more about rate of change in <xref ref="slope-and-rate-of-change" text="type-global"/>.)  Their graphs were all portions of straight lines.  For this reason such equations are called  <term>linear equations</term><idx>linear equations</idx>.  The order of the terms in the equation does not matter.  For example, the equation in <xref ref="example-Annelise" text="type-global"/>, 
    <me>C=5+3t</me> 
can be written equivalently as 
    <me>-3t+C=5</me> 
and the equation in <xref ref="example-home-price" text="type-global"/>, 
    <me>P=92,000+4700t</me> 
can be written as 
    <me>-4700t +P=92,000</me> 
This form of a linear equation, <m> Ax+By=C </m>, is called the <term>general form</term><idx>general form</idx>.</p>

<assemblage><title>General Form for a Linear Equation</title>
    <p>The graph of any equation <me>Ax+By=C</me> where <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> are not both equal to zero, is a straight line.</p></assemblage>

<example xml:id="example-advertising"><statement><p>The manager at Albert's Appliances has $3000 to spend on advertising for the next fiscal quarter.  A 30-second spot on television costs $150 per broadcast, and a 30-second radio ad costs $50.</p><p><ol label="a">
    <li><p>The manager decides to buy <m>x</m> television ads and <m>y</m> radio ads.  Write an equation relating <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>.</p></li>
    <li><p>Make a table of values showing several choices for <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>.</p></li>
    <li><p>Plot the points from your table, and graph the equation.</p></li>
    </ol></p></statement>
    
<solution><p><ol label="a">
    <li><p>Each television ad costs $150, so <m>x</m> ads will cost $<m>150x</m>.  Similarly, <m>y</m> radio ads will cost $<m>50y</m>.  The manager has $3000 to spend, so the sum of the costs must be $3000.  Thus, 
            <me>150x+50y=3000</me></p></li>
    <li><p>We choose some values of <m>x</m>, and solve the equation for the corresponding value of <m>y</m>.  For example, if <m>x=\alert{10}</m> then
               <md><mrow>150(\alert{10})+50y\amp=300</mrow>
                <mrow>1500+50y\amp=3000</mrow>
                <mrow>50y\amp=1500</mrow>
                <mrow>y\amp=30</mrow></md>
        If the manager buys 10 television ads, she can also buy 30 radio ads.  You can verify the other entries in the table.</p>

<subsection><title>Intercept Method for Graphing Lines</title>

            <p>The <m>y</m>-intercept is the point <m>(0, -50)</m>.</p></li>
            <li><p>We scale both axes in intervals of 10 and then plot the two intercepts, <m>(60, 0)</m> and <m>(0, -50)</m>. We draw the line through them, as shown below. Finally, we find another point and check that it lies on this line. We choose <m>x = \alert{20}</m> and solve for <m>y</m>.
            <md><mrow>150(\alert{20}) -180y \amp = 9000</mrow>
            <mrow>3000 -180y \amp = 9000</mrow>
            <mrow>-180y \amp = 6000</mrow>
            <mrow>y \amp =-33.\overline{3}</mrow></md>

            We plot the point <m>(20, -33\frac{1}{3})</m>. Because this point lies on the line, we can be reasonably confident that our graph is correct. </p>
