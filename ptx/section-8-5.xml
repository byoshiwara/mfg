<title>Linear Programming</title>

<introduction>
<p>The term <term>linear programming</term><idx>linear programming</idx> was coined in the late 1940s. It describes a relatively young branch of mathematics, compared to subjects such as Euclidean geometry, where the major ideas were already well understood 23 centuries ago. (The Greek mathematician Euclid wrote what can be considered the first geometry textbook about 300 B.C.) Business managers routinely solve linear programming problems for purchasing and marketing strategy, so it is possible that linear programming affects your daily life as much as any other branch of mathematics.</p></introduction>

<subsection><title>The Objective Function and Constraints</title>

<p>TrailGear would like to maximize its profit from selling hiking boots. The company produces two kinds of hiking boots, a Weekender model, on which it makes $<m>8</m> profit per pair, and a Sierra model, on which it makes $<m>10</m> profit per pair. How many of each model should TrailGear produce each week in order to maximize its profit?</p>

<p>If we let <m>x</m> represent the number of Weekender boots and <m>y</m> the number of Sierra boots TrailGear produces, then the total weekly profit is given by
	   <me>P = 8x + 10y</me>
This expression for <m>P</m> is called the <term>objective function</term><idx>objective function</idx>. The goal of a linear programming problem is to maximize or minimize such an objective function, subject to one or more constraints.</p>

<p>If TrailGear had infinite resources and an infinite market, there would be no limit to the profit it could earn by producing more and more hiking boots. However, every business has to consider many factors, including its supplies of labor and materials, overhead and shipping costs, and the size of the market for its product. To keep things simple, we will concentrate on just two of these factors.</p>

<p>Each pair of Weekender boots requires <m>3</m> hours of labor to produce, and each pair of Sierra boots requires <m>6</m> hours. TrailGear has available <m>2400</m> hours of labor per week. Thus, <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> must satisfy the inequality
	   <me>3x + 6y \le 2400</me>
In addition, suppose that TrailGear's suppliers can provide at most <m>1000</m> ounces of silicone gel each week, with each pair of Weekenders using <m>2</m> ounces and each Sierra model using <m>1</m> ounce. This means that
	   <me>2x + y \le 1000</me>
Of course, we will also require that <m>x\ge 0</m> and <m>y\ge 0</m>. These four inequalities are called the <term>constraints</term><idx>constraints</idx> of the problem.</p>

<subsection><title>Feasible Solutions</title>

<p>We have formulated the original problem into an objective function
	   <me>P = 8x + 10y</me>
and a system of inequalities called the constraints.
	<md><mrow>3x + 6y \amp\le 2400</mrow>
		<mrow>2x + y \amp\le 1000</mrow>
		<mrow>x \ge 0, ~~\amp y \ge 0</mrow></md></p>

<sidebyside widths="55% 40%" valigns="middle middle"><p>
Our goal is to find values for <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> that satisfy the constraints and produce the maximum value for <m>P</m>. We begin by graphing the solutions to the constraint inequalities. These solutions are shown in the shaded region in at right. The points in this region are called <term>feasible solutions</term><idx>feasible solutions</idx> because they are the only values we can consider while looking for the maximum value of the objective function <m>P</m>.</p>

<subsection><title>The Optimum Solutions</title>

<p>We cannot check all of the feasible solutions to see which one results in the largest profit. Fortunately, there is a simple way to find the <term>optimal solution</term><idx>optimal solution</idx>.</p>

<p>Consider the objective function,
	   <me>P = 8x + 10y</me>
Suppose TrailGear would like to make <m>$2000</m> on hiking. It could produce <m>200</m> pairs of Sierra boots, or <m>250</m> pairs of Weekenders. Or it could produce some of each; for example, <m>50</m> pairs of Weekenders and <m>160</m> pairs of Sierra boots. In fact, every point on the line 
	   <me>8x + 10y = 2000</me>
represents a combination of Weekenders and Sierra boots that will yield a profit of $<m>2000</m>. This line is labeled <m>P = 2000</m> in the figure below.</p>
    <image width="50%" source="images/fig-objective-function-contours-over-feasibles"><description>lines of constant objective function drawn over feasible solutions</description></image>

<p>If TrailGear would like to make $<m>4000</m> on boots, it should choose a point on the line labeled <m>P = 4000</m>. Similarly, all the points on the line labeled <m>P = 6000</m> will yield a profit of $<m>6000</m>, and so on. Different values of <m>P</m> correspond to parallel lines on the graph. Smaller values of <m>P</m> correspond to lines near the origin, and larger values of <m>P</m> have lines farther from the origin.</p>

<p>We are only allowed to choose points from the set of feasible solutions. Imagine the parallel lines representing different values of the objective function sweeping across the graph of the feasible solutions. The objective values increase as the lines sweep up across the graph.</p>
<p> What is the last feasible solution the lines intersect before leaving the shaded region? If you study the preceding examples, perhaps you can see that the largest (and smallest) values of the objective function will occur at corner points of the set of feasible solutions. We have not proved this fact, but it is true.</p>

<assemblage><title>Linear Programming</title>
<p>The maximum and the minimum values of the objective function always occur at vertices of the graph of feasible solutions.</p>
</assemblage>

<p>Depending on the exact formula for the objective function, the maximum and minimum values may occur at <em>any</em> of the vertices of the shaded region.</p>

<example><statement><p>Find TrailGear's maximum weekly profit.</p></statement>

<p>The maximum value of the profit, <m>P</m>, corresponds to the topmost line that intersects the region of feasible solutions.

<p>In <xref ref="example-unbounded-feasible-set" text="type-global"/>, the set of feasible solutions is an unbounded region.</p>

<example xml:id="example-unbounded-feasible-set"><statement><p>Each week, the Healthy Food Store buys both granola and muesli in bulk from two cereal companies. The store requires at least <m>12</m> kilograms of granola and <m>9</m> kilograms of muesli. <ul>

        First, we write the objective function. The store would like to minimize its cost, so

<technology><title><!--<image source="images/icon-GC.jpg"  width="8%"><description>Graphing Calculator</description></image>-->Using a Graphing Calculator</title>

<p>You can use your graphing calculator to solve the problem in <xref ref="example-unbounded-feasible-set" text="type-global"/>. Set the window values at
	<md><mrow>\text{Xmin} \amp = 0 \amp\amp \text{Xmax} = 9.4</mrow>
		<mrow>\text{Ymin} \amp = 0 \amp\amp \text{Ymax} = 6.2</mrow></md>
Next, graph the set of feasible solutions. We have already taken care of the constraints <m>x\ge 0</m> and <m>y\ge 0</m> by setting Xmin and Ymin to zero. Solve each of the other constraints for <m>y</m> to get
	<md><mrow>y \amp\ge (12 - 2x)/3</mrow>
		<mrow>y \amp\ge(9 - x)/3</mrow></md>
For each constraint, the set of feasible solutions lies above the boundary line, because <m>y</m> is greater than the expression in <m>x</m>. To shade the regions above the graphs of <m>Y_1</m> and <m>Y_2</m>, move the cursor onto the backslash in front of the equations and press <kbd>ENTER</kbd> twice, as shown in figure (a). Then press <kbd>GRAPH</kbd>. Your display should look like figure (b).</p>
	<image width="70%" source="images/fig-GC-feasible.jpg" ><description>GCdisplays for graphing systems of inequalities</description></image>

<p>The feasible solutions lie in the crosshatched region that is shaded with both the vertical and horizontal lines. We will use the calculator to evaluate the objective function at each vertex. First, use the <kbd>TRACE</kbd> (or <em>value</em> or <em>intersect</em> feature) to find the coordinates of one of the vertices, say <m>(0, 4)</m>. Then press <kbd>2nd</kbd> <kbd>QUIT</kbd> to get back to the <em>Home</em> screen; enter the formula for the objective function by keying in
	   <me>15X + 25Y</me>
(Enter <m>Y</m> by pressing <kbd>ALPHA</kbd> <m>1</m>.) Your calculator has stored the values <m>x=0</m> and <m>y=4</m> from the <kbd>TRACE</kbd> key, so when you press <kbd>ENTER</kbd>, the calculator returns <m>100</m> for the value of <m>C</m> at that point. Thus, when <m>x=0</m> and <m>y=4</m>, <m>C=100</m>.</p>

<p>Similarly, you can verify that <m>C=135</m> when <m>x=9</m> and <m>y=0</m>, and that when <m>x=3</m> and <m>y=2</m>, <m>C-95</m>. Thus, the minimum cost of <m>\$95</m> occurs when <m>x=3</m> and <m>y=2</m>.</p></technology>
