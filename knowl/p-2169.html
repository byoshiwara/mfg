	Some applications are best described by a system of two or more inequalities. The solutions to a system of inequalities include all points that are solutions to each inequality in the system. The graph of the system is the intersection of the shaded regions for each inequality in the system. For example, <a knowl="./knowl/fig-system-of-inequalities.html" knowl-id="xref-fig-system-of-inequalities" alt="Figure 8.4.12 " title="Figure 8.4.12 ">Figure 8.4.12</a> shows the solutions of the system
	\begin{equation*}
		y \gt x ~~~\text{ and }~~~ y \gt 2
	\end{equation*}
