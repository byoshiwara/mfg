<subsection><title>Fitting an Exponential Function through Two Points</title>

<p>To write a formula for an exponential function, we need to know the initial value, <m>a</m>, and the growth or decay factor, <m>b</m>. We can find these two parameters if we know any two function values.</p>

<example xml:id="example-fit-exponential"><statement><p>Find an exponential function that has the values <m>f(2) = 4.5</m> and <m>f(5) = 121.5</m>.</p></statement>

<solution><p>We would like to find values of <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> so that the given function values satisfy <m>f (x) = ab^x</m> . By substituting the function values into the formula, we can write two equations.
	<!--*****--><me>\begin{aligned}[t]
	               f(2) \amp= 4.5~~~ \text{ means }~~~x = 2, y = 4.5, \amp\amp\text{so }ab^2 = 4.5\\
	               f(5) \amp= 121.5~~~ \text{ means }~~~x = 5, y = 121.5, \amp\amp\text{so }ab^5 = 121.5
	\end{aligned}</me><!--*****-->
This is a system of equations in the two unknowns, <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>, but it is not a linear system. We can solve the system by the method of elimination, but we will divide one of the equations by the other.
	<!--*****--><me>\begin{aligned}[t]
	               \frac{ab^5}{ab^2}\amp= \frac{121.5}{4.5}\\
	               b^3 \amp = 27
	               \end{aligned}</me><!--*****-->
Note that by dividing the two equations, we eliminated <m>a</m>, and we can now solve for <m>b</m>.
	<!--*****--><me>\begin{aligned}[t]
	               b^3 \amp = 27 \\
	               b \amp = \sqrt[3]{27} = 3
	               \end{aligned}</me><!--*****-->
Next we substitute <m>b = 3</m> into either of the two equations and solve for <m>a</m>.
	<!--*****--><me>\begin{aligned}[t]
	               a(3)^2 \amp = 4.5 \\
	               a \amp= \frac{4.5}{9} \\
	               \amp = 0.5
	               \end{aligned}</me><!--*****-->
Thus, <m>a = 0.5</m> and <m>b = 3</m>, so the function is <m>f (x) = 0.5(3^ x )</m>.</p></solution></example>

<warning><p>Knowing only two points on the graph of f is not enough to tell us what <em>kind</em> of function <m>f</m> is. Through the two points in <xref ref="example-fit-exponential" text="type-global"/>, we can also fit a linear function or a power function. </p>
	<sidebyside widths="50% 45%" valigns="middle middle"><p>You can check that the three functions below all satisfy <m>f(2) = 4.5</m> and <m>f(5) = 121.5</m>. The graphs of the functions are shown at right.
	<!--*****--><me>\begin{aligned}[t]
	               L(x) \amp = -73.5 + 39x \\
	               P(x) \amp = 0.372x^{3.6} \\
	               E(x) \amp = 0.5(3^x ) \\
	               \end{aligned}</me><!--*****--></p>

</warning>

<p>However, if we already know that we are looking for an exponential function, we can follow the steps below to find its formula. This method is sometimes called the <term>ratio method</term><idx>ratio method</idx>. (Of course, if one of the known function values is the initial value, we can find <m>b</m> without resorting to the ratio method.)</p>

<p>We can use the ratio method to find an exponential growth or decay model if we know two function values.</p>

<example xml:id="example-cedi-inflation"><statement><p>The unit of currency in Ghana is the cedi, denoted by ¢. Beginning in 1986, the cedi underwent a period of exponential inflation. In 1993, one U.S. dollar was worth ¢720, and in 1996, the dollar was worth about ¢1620. Find a formula for the number of cedi to the dollar as a function of time since 1986. What was the annual inflation rate?</p></statement>

<solution><p>We want to find a function <m>C(t) = ab^t</m> for the number of cedi to the dollar, where <m>t = 0</m> in 1986. We have two function values, <m>C(7) = 720</m>, and <m>C(10) = 1620</m>, and with these values we can write two equations.
	<!--*****--><me>\begin{aligned}[t]
	               ab^7 \amp = 720 \\
	               ab^{10} \amp = 1620
	               \end{aligned}</me><!--*****-->
We divide the second equation by the first to find
	<!--*****--><me>\begin{aligned}[t]
	               \frac{ab^{10}}{ab^7} \amp= \frac{1620}{720} \\
	               b^3 \amp= 2.25
	               \end{aligned}</me><!--*****-->
Now we can solve this last equation for <m>b</m> to get <m>b = \sqrt[3]{2.25}\approx 1.31</m>. Finally, we substitute <m>b = 1.31</m> into the first equation to find <m>a</m>.
	<!--*****--><me>\begin{aligned}[t]
	               a(1.31)^7 \amp = 720 \\
	               a \amp = \frac{720}{1.317} \\
	               \amp = 108.75
	               \end{aligned}</me><!--*****-->
Thus, <m>C(t) = 108.75(1.31)^t</m> , and the annual inflation rate was <m>31</m>%.</p></solution></example>

<subsection><title>Doubling Time</title><idx>doubling time</idx>

<p>Instead of giving the rate of growth of a population, we can specify its rate of growth by giving the time it takes for the population to double.</p>

<subsection><title>Half-Life</title>

<p>The <term>half-life</term><idx>half-life</idx> of a decreasing exponential function is the time it takes for the output to decrease to half its original value. For example, the half-life of a radioactive isotope is the time it takes for half of the substance to decay. The half-life of a drug is the time it takes for half of the drug to be eliminated from the body. Like the doubling time, the half-life is constant for a particular function; no matter where you start, it takes the same amount of time to reach half that value.</p>

<example xml:id="example-ibuprofen"><statement>
<p>If you take <m>200</m> mg of ibuprofen to relieve sore muscles, the amount of the drug left in your body after <m>t</m> hours is <m>Q(t) = 200(0.73)^t</m>.</p>

<p>Just as we can write an exponential growth law in terms of its doubling time, we can use the half-life to write a formula for exponential decay. For example, the  half-life of ibuprofen is <m>2.2</m> hours, so every <m>2.2</m> hours the amount remaining is reduced by a factor of <m>0.5</m>. After <m>t</m> hours a <m>200</m>-mg dose will be reduced to
	<me>Q(t) = 200(0.5)^{t/2.2}</me>
Once again, you can check that this formula is equivalent to the decay function given in <xref ref="example-ibuprofen" text="type-global"/>.</p>

<assemblage><title>Half-Life</title><idx>half-life</idx>

<p>Radioactive isotopes are molecules that decay into more stable molecules, emitting radiation in the process. Although radiation in large doses is harmful to living things, radioactive isotopes are useful as tracers in medicine and industry, and as treatment against cancer. The decay laws for radioactive isotopes are often given in terms of their half-lives.</p>

<example xml:id="example-cobalt-60"><statement>
<p>Cobalt-60 is used in cold pasteurization to sterilize certain types of food. Gamma rays emitted by the isotope during radioactive decay kill any bacteria present without damaging the food. The half-life of cobalt-60 is <m>5.27</m> years.

<p>Payments on a loan, such as a home mortgage, are also an annuity, but in this case the monthly payments do not collect interest; instead, we must pay interest on the present value of the loan. Repaying a loan (plus interest) by making a sequence of equal payments is called <term>amortizing</term><idx>amortize</idx> the loan.</p>
