                <subsection>
                   <title>Tables, Graphs and Equations</title>   
                   <p>The first step in creating a model is to describe relationships between variables.  In Investigation 1 <xref provisional="investigation-commission" />, we analyzed the relationship between Delbert's sales and his income.  Starting from the verbal description of his income, we represented the relationship by a table of values, a graph, and an algebraic equation.  Each of these mathematical tools is useful in a different way.</p>
                   <ol>
                       <li><p>A <term index="yes">table of values</term> displays specific data points with precise numerical values.</p></li>
                       <li><p>A <term index="yes">graph</term> is a visual display of the data.  It is easier to spot trends and describe the overall behavior of the variables from a graph.</p></li>
                       <li><p>An <term index="yes">algebraic equation</term> is a compact summary of the model.  It can be used to analyze the model and to make predictions</p></li>
                   </ol>
                    <p>We begin our study of modeling with some examples of <term index="yes">linear models</term>.  In the examples that follow, observe the interplay among the three modeling tools, and how each contributes to the model.</p>

<title>Choosing Scales for the Axes</title>
 <p>To draw a useful graph, we must choose appropriate scales for the axes.  They must extend far enough to show the values of the variables, and the tick marks should be equally spaced.  Usually no more than 10 or 15 tick marks are needed.</p>

 <example xml:id="example-home-price">
    <p>In 1990, the median home price in the US was <dollar />92,000.  The median price increased by about <dollar />4700 per year over the next decade.
        <ol label="*a*">
            <li><p> Make a table of values showing the median price of a house in 1990, 1994, 1998, and 2000.</p></li>
            <li><p> Choose suitable scales for the axes and plot the values you found in part (a) on a graph. Use <m>t</m>, the number of years since 1990, on the horizontal axis and the price of the house, <m>P</m>, on the vertical axis.  Draw a curve through the points.</p></li>
            <li><p> Write an equation that expresses <m>P</m> in terms of <m>t</m>.</p></li>
            <li><p> How much did the price of the house increase from 1990 to 1996?  Illustrate the increase on your graph.</p></li>
        </ol>
    </p>
    <solution>
    <ol label="*a*">
        <li><p>In 1990 the median price was <dollar />92,000.  Four years later, in 1994, the price had increased by <m>\alert{4}(4700)=18,800</m> dollars, so
        <me>P=92,000+\alert{4}(4700)=110,800</me>
        In 1998 the price had increased by <m>\alert{8}(4700)=37,600</m>  dollars, so
        <me>P=92,000+\alert{8}(4700)-129,600</me>
        You can verify the price of the house in 2000 by a similar calculation.</p>

             look at the values in the table.

    <title>Linear Equations</title>
    <p>All the models in these examples have equations with a similar form:  <me>y=\text{(starting value)}+\text{(rate of change)}\cdot x</me>
(We'll talk more about rate of change in Section 1.4.)  Their graphs were all portions of straight lines.  For this reason such equations are called  <term index="yes">linear equations</term>.  The order of the terms in the equation does not matter.  For example, the equation in Example 1, <me>C=5+3t</me> can be written equivalently as <me>-3t+C=5</me> and the equation in Example 3, <me>P=92,000+4700t</me> can be written as <me>-4700+P=92,000</me> 
This form of a linear equation, <me>Ax+By=C</me> is called the <term index="yes">general form</term>.</p>

    <title>Intercept Method for Graphing Lines</title>
    <p>Because we really only need two points to graph a linear equation, we might as well find the intercepts first and use them to draw the graph. The values of the intercepts will also help us choose suitable scales for the axes. It is always a good idea to find a third point as a check.
    </p>

            <p>The <m>x</m>-intercept is the point <m>(60, 0)</m>. To find the <m>y</m>-intercept, set <m>x = \alert{0}</m>.</p>
