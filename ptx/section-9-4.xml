<subsection><title>Summation Notation</title>

<p>There is a convenient notation for representing a series. For example, consider the sum of the first fifteen terms of the sequence
    <me>4, 7, 10, \cdots, 3n+1, \cdots</me>
To find the terms of the series we replace <m>n</m> in the general term <m>3n+1</m> by the numbers 1 through 15. So, instead of writing out all the terms, we might express the sum as
    <me>\text{The sum, as}~ n~ \text{runs from 1 to 15, of}~ 3n+1</me>
We use the Greek letter <m>\Sigma</m> (called "sigma") to stand for "the sum," and we show the first and last values of <m>n</m> below and above the summation symbol <m>\Sigma</m>, like this:
    <me>\sum_{n=1}^{15} 3n+1</me>
Writing such an expression is sometimes called "using <term>sigma notation</term>."  The letter <m>n</m> is called the <term>index of summation</term>; it is like a variable because it represents numerical values.  </p> 

<note><p>Any letter can be used for the index of summation; <m>i,~j,</m> and <m>k</m> are other common choices. Of course, the letter used for the index of summation does not affect the sum.</p></note>  

<example><statement><p>Use sigma notation to represent the sum of the first 20 terms of the sequence
<me>-1, 2, 7, \cdots, k^2-2, \cdots</me></p></statement>

<solution><p>The general term of the sequence is <m>k^2-2</m>, and the first term is <m>-1</m>, which we find by letting <m>k=1</m> in the formula for the general term.  Thus,
<me>\sum_{k=1}^{20} (k^2-2)</me></p></solution></example>

<p>The <term>expanded form</term> of a series written in sigma notation is obtained by writing out all the terms of the series.  For example,
    <me>\sum_{m=4}^{8} \dfrac{3}{m} = \dfrac{3}{4} + \dfrac{3}{5} + \dfrac{3}{6} + \dfrac{3}{7} + \dfrac{3}{8}</me></p>

<note><p>Notice that the series above has five terms, which is one more than the difference of the upper and lower limits of summation, <m>8 - 4</m>.</p></note> 

<p>Recall that the general term of an arithmetic series is a linear function of the index, and the general term of a geometric series is an exponential function. If we recognize a given series as one of these two types, we can use the formulas developed in the last section to evaluate the sum.</p>

<example><statement><p>Compute the value of each series.</p><p><ol marker= "a" cols="2">
    <li><m>\displaystyle{\sum_{i=1}^{13} (90-5i)}</m></li>
    <li><m>\displaystyle{\sum_{k=0}^{9} 2^k}</m></li></ol></p></statement>

<solution><p><ol marker= "a">
    <li><p>Because the general term <m>90-5i</m> is linear, this is an arithmetic series. By writing out the first few terms of the series,
        <me>85+80+75+70+\cdots</me>
    we can verify that the first term of the series is <m>a_1=85</m> and the common difference is <m>d=-5</m>.  We also need to know the last term of the series, so we substitute <m>n=13</m> in the general term to find <m>a_{13} = 90-5(13) = 25</m>
    Thus,
        <me>\sum_{i=1}^{13} (90-5i) = \dfrac{13}{2}(85+25) = 715</me></p></li>
    <li><p>The general term of this series is exponential, so the series is geometric. By writing out a few terms of the series,
        <me>1+2+4+8+\cdots</me>
    we confirm that the first term of the series is <m>a_1=1</m> and the common ratio is <m>r=2</m>. The series has 10 terms, from <m>k=0</m> to <m>k=9</m>, so <m>n=10</m>. Finally, we substitute these values into the formula for geometric series to obtain  
        <me> \sum_{k=0}^{9} 2^k = \dfrac{1(1-2^{10})}{1-2} = 1023</me></p></li></ol></p></solution></example>

<p>If the series is not arithmetic or geometric, we don't have a formula for the sum, so we must compute the sum directly.</p>

<example><statement><p>Compute the value of each series.</p><p><ol marker= "a" cols="2">
    <li><m>\displaystyle{\sum_{m=1}^{5} m^2}</m></li>
    <li><m>\displaystyle{\sum_{p=1}^{800} 5}</m></li></ol></p></statement>

<solution><p><ol marker= "a">
    <li><p>Because the general term, <m>m^2</m>, is neither linear nor exponential, we know that the series is not arithmetic or geometric.  However, we can expand the series and evaluate it directly.
        <!--*****--><me>\begin{aligned}[t]
                \displaystyle{\sum_{m=1}^{5} m^2}\amp = 1^2+2^2+3^2+4^2+5^2\\

    <li><p>The general term is the number 5. Because the index <m>p</m> runs from 1 to 800, we are adding 800 terms, each of which is 5. Thus

                \displaystyle{\sum_{p=1}^{800} 5}\amp = 5+5+5+\cdots+5+5\\

<subsection><title>Infinite Series</title>

<p>A series with infinitely many terms is called an <term>infinite series</term>. Is it possible to add infinitely many terms and arrive at a finite sum?  In some cases, if the terms added are small enough, the answer is yes.</p>  
<p>
    Consider the infinite geometric series
    <me>\dfrac{1}{2}+\dfrac{1}{4}+\dfrac{1}{8}+\dfrac{1}{16}+\cdots</me>
    The <m>n^{\text{th}}</m> <term>partial sum</term> of the series is the sum of its first <m>n</m> terms, and is denoted by <m>S_n</m>.  Thus,
    <md>
        <mrow>S_1\amp = \dfrac{1}{2}</mrow>
        <mrow>S_2 \amp = \dfrac{1}{2}+\dfrac{1}{4} = \dfrac{3}{4}</mrow>
        <mrow>S_3 \amp = \dfrac{1}{2}+\dfrac{1}{4}+\dfrac{1}{8} = \dfrac{7}{8}</mrow>
        <mrow>S_4 \amp = \dfrac{1}{2}+\dfrac{1}{4}+\dfrac{1}{8}+\dfrac{1}{16} = \dfrac{15}{16}</mrow>
    </md>
    Notice that for each partial sum, the new term added gets smaller and smaller: <m>\dfrac{1}{2}</m>, <m>\dfrac{1}{4}</m>, <m>\dfrac{1}{8}</m>, <m>\dfrac{1}{16},</m> and so on.  You can also see that as <m>n</m> increases and we add more and more terms of the series, the partial sums are getting closer to 1.  In fact, as <m>n</m> becomes very large, <m>S_n</m>  gets very close to 1.  It seems reasonable that the sum of all the terms of the series is 1.
</p>

<note><p>Will the partial sums ever be greater than 1?  No, because each new term <m>a_n</m> added is half the difference between  <m>S_n</m> and 1.</p></note>

<p>
    We can make this conjecture more plausible by examining the formula for the <m>n^{\text{th}}</m> partial sum of a geometric series,
    <md>
        <mrow>S_n\amp = \dfrac{a_{n+1} - a_1}{r-1}</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp = \dfrac{ar^n - a}{r-1} = \dfrac{a - ar^n}{1-r} \amp\amp (r \not= 1)</mrow>
    </md>
    Look at the second term of the numerator, <m>ar^n</m>. This term is the only part of the formula that depends on <m>n</m>.  What happens to <m>ar^n</m> as <m>n</m> increases?  Consider two examples: 
</p>
<p><ul>
    <li><p>
        If <m>r = \dfrac{1}{2}</m>, then
        <me>r^2 = \left(\dfrac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \dfrac{1}{4},\qquad r^3 = \left(\dfrac{1}{2}\right)^3 = \dfrac{1}{8},\qquad r^4 = \left(\dfrac{1}{2}\right)^4 = \dfrac{1}{16},</me>
        and so on, with <m>\left(\dfrac{1}{2}\right)^n</m> becoming smaller and smaller for larger values of <m>n</m>. Each time we multiply by another factor of <m>r=\dfrac{1}{2}</m>, the product gets smaller, because <m>\dfrac{1}{2} \lt 1</m>.
    </p></li>
    <li><p>
        On the other hand, if <m>r \gt 1</m>, multiplying by <m>r</m> makes the product larger.  If <m>r = \dfrac{3}{2}</m> for example, then
        <me>r^2 = \left(\dfrac{3}{2}\right)^2 = \dfrac{9}{4},\qquad r^3 = \left(\dfrac{3}{2}\right)^3 = \dfrac{27}{8},\qquad r^4 = \left(\dfrac{3}{2}\right)^4 = \dfrac{81}{16},</me>
        and so on.  In this case the powers of <m>r</m> are increasing.
    </p></li>
</ul></p>

<p>In general, we have the following result.</p>

<assemblage><p><ol marker= "1">
    <li>If <m>0 \lt \abs{r} \lt 1</m>,  then <m>r^n</m> gets closer to zero as  <m>n</m> increases.</li> 
    <li>If  <m>\abs{r} \gt 1</m>, then <m>r^n</m> does not approach a finite number as  <m>n</m>  increases.</li></ol></p></assemblage>

<p>Now let's return to the formula for <m>S_n</m> and write it in the form
    <me>S_n = \dfrac{a}{1-r} (1-r^n)</me>
where we have factored <m>a</m> from the numerator.  There are two cases to consider. If <m>\abs{r} \lt 1</m>, then <m>r^n</m> approaches 0, and the factor <m>1-r^n</m>  gets closer and closer to 1 as <m>n</m> grows larger.  Consequently, if we compute <m>S_n</m> for larger and larger values of <m>n</m>, the sum approaches the value
    <me>\dfrac{a}{1-r}</me>
This analysis motivates us to define the sum of an infinite geometric series as follows.</p>
 
 <assemblage><title>Sum of an Infinite Geometric Series</title>
 <p>The sum of an infinite geometric series <m>~~\displaystyle{\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} ar^{k-1}}~~</m> is
 <me>S_{\infty} = \dfrac{a}{1-r}~~~~~~\text{if}~~~~-1 \lt r \lt 1</me></p></assemblage> 
              
<p>In the second case, if <m>\abs{r} \gt 1</m>,  as in the infinite series
    <me>3 + 6 + 12 + \cdots</me>
where  <m>r = 2</m>, the terms become larger as <m>n</m> increases, and the sum of the series is not a finite number.  In this case the series does not have a sum.</p>

<subsection><title>Repeating Decimals</title>

<p>An interesting application of geometric series involves repeating decimals. Recall that the decimal representation of a rational number either terminates, as does <m>0.75, </m> or repeats a pattern of digits. For example, you probably recognize <m>0.333\overline{3}</m> as the decimal representation of  <m>\dfrac{1}{3}</m>. It is easy to find the decimal form of a fraction:  we just divide the denominator into the numerator. Is there a way to find the fractional form of a repeating decimal?</p>

<p>Consider the repeating decimal
        <me>0.2121\overline{21}</me>
We can write this number as an infinite geometric series:
        <me>0.21 + 0.0021 + 0.000021 + \cdots</me>
The first term of this series is <m>0.21</m>, or <m>\dfrac{21}{100}</m>, and its common ratio is <m>r=0.01</m>, or <m>\dfrac{1}{100}</m>. Because <m>\abs{r} \lt 1</m>, the series has a sum given by
    <!--*****--><me>\begin{aligned}[t]
                S_{\infty}\amp = \dfrac{a}{1-r} = \dfrac{\dfrac{21}{100}}{1-\dfrac{1}{100}}\\
                \amp = \dfrac{\dfrac{21}{100}}{\dfrac{99}{100}} = \dfrac{21}{99} = \dfrac{7}{33}\\                
                \end{aligned}</me><!--*****-->
Thus, the decimal number <m>0.2121\overline{21}</m> is equal to the fraction <m>\dfrac{7}{33}</m>. </p>

<example><statement><p>Find a common fraction equivalent to  <m>0.3\overline{7}</m>.</p></statement>

<solution><p>The decimal can be written as <m>0.3 + 0.0\overline{7}</m>.  We will find a fraction equivalent to the repeating decimal <m>0.0\overline{7}</m> and add that to <m>0.3</m>, or <m>\dfrac{3}{10}</m>.  We write <m>0.0\overline{7}</m> as a series:
    <me>0.0\overline{7} = \dfrac{7}{100} + \dfrac{7}{1000} + \dfrac{7}{10,000} + \cdots</me>
This is an infinite geometric series with first term <m>\dfrac{7}{100}</m> and common ratio <m>\dfrac{1}{10}</m>.  The sum of the series is given by 
    <!--*****--><me>\begin{aligned}[t]
                S_{\infty}\amp = \dfrac{a}{1-r} = \dfrac{\dfrac{7}{100}}{1-\dfrac{1}{10}}\\
                \amp = \dfrac{\dfrac{7}{100}}{\dfrac{9}{10}} = \dfrac{7}{100} \cdot \dfrac{9}{10} = \dfrac{7}{90}\\                
                \end{aligned}</me><!--*****-->

Finally, we add <m>\dfrac{7}{90}</m> and <m>\dfrac{3}{10}</m> to find
    <me>0.3\overline{7} = \dfrac{3}{10}+\dfrac{7}{90} = \dfrac{34}{90}</me></p></solution></example>
