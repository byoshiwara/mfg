<title>Factors and <m>x</m>-Intercepts</title>

<introduction><p>In <xref ref="investigation-height-of-baseball" text="type-global"/>, perhaps you recognized the graph of the baseball's height as a parabola. In this chapter, we shall see that the graph of any quadratic function is a parabola.</p>

<xi:include href="./assemblage-quadratic-function.xml" />

<note><p>In the definition above, notice that if <m>a</m> is zero, there is no <m>x</m>-squared term, so the function is not quadratic.</p></note>

<p>In <xref ref="investigation-height-of-baseball" text="type-global"/>, the height of a baseball <m>t</m> seconds after being hit was given by
	<me>h = -16t^2 + 64t + 4</me>
We used a graph to find two times when the baseball was <m>64</m> feet high. Can we solve the same problem algebraically?</p>

<p>We are looking for values of <m>t</m> that produce <m>h = 64</m> in the height equation. So, if we substitute <m>h = 64</m> into the height equation, we would like to solve the <term>quadratic equation</term>
	<me>64 = -16t^2 + 64t + 4</me>
This equation cannot be solved by extraction of roots, because there are two terms containing the variable <m>t</m>, and they cannot be combined. To solve this equation, we will appeal to a property of our number system, called the <term>zero-factor principle</term>.</p></introduction>

<subsection><title>Zero-Factor Principle</title>

<p>Can you multiply two numbers together and obtain a product of zero? Only if one of the two numbers happens to be zero. This property of numbers is called the <term>zero-factor principle</term>.</p>

<xi:include href="./assemblage-zero-factor-principle.xml" />

<p>The principle is true even if the numbers <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> are represented by algebraic expressions, such as <m>x - 5</m> or <m>2x + 1</m>. For example, if
	<me>(x - 5)(2x + 1) = 0</me>
then it must be true that either <m>x - 5 = 0</m> or <m>2x + 1 = 0</m>. Thus, we can use the zero-factor principle to solve equations.</p>

<example xml:id="example-ZFP"><statement><p><ol marker="a.">
	<li>Solve the equation <m>(x - 6)(x + 2) = 0</m>.</li>
	<li>Find the <m>x</m>-intercepts of the graph of <m>f(x) = x^2 - 4x - 12</m>.</li>
	</ol></p></statement>

<solution><p><ol marker="a.">
	<li><p>We apply the zero-factor principle to the product <m>(x - 6)(x + 2)</m>.

	There are two solutions, <m>6</m> and <m>-2</m>. (You should check that both of these values satisfy the original equation.)</p></li>
	<li><p>To find the <m>x</m>-intercepts of the graph, we set <m>y = 0</m> and solve the equation 
			<me>0 = x^2 - 4x - 12</me>
	But this is the equation we solved in part (a), because <m>(x - 6)(x + 2) = x^2 - 4x - 12</m>.
	The solutions of that equation were <m>6</m> and <m>-2</m>, so the <m>x</m>-intercepts of the graph are <m>6</m> and <m>-2</m>. You can see this by graphing the equation on your calculator, as shown below.</p>

<subsection><title>Solving Quadratic Equations by Factoring</title>

<p>Before we apply the zero-factor principle to solve a quadratic equation, we must first write the equation so that one side of the equation is zero. Let us introduce some terminology.</p>

<assemblage><title>Forms for Quadratic Equations</title>
<p><ol>
	<li>A quadratic equation written
			 <me>ax^2 + bx + c = 0</me>
	 is in <term>standard form</term><idx>standard form</idx>.</li>
	<li>A quadratic equation written 
			<me>a(x - r_1)(x - r_2) = 0</me>
	is in <term>factored form</term><idx>factored form</idx>.</li>
	</ol></p></assemblage>

<p>Once we have written the equation in standard form, we factor the left side and set each variable factor equal to zero separately. (See <xref ref="appendix-Factoring-Quadratic-Trinomials" text="custom">Appendix A.8 Factoring Quadratic Trinomials</xref> to review factoring.) </p>

<example xml:id="example-quadratic-via-factoring"><statement><p>Solve <m>~~3x(x + 1) = 2x + 2</m></p></statement>
<solution><p>First, we write the equation in standard form.
		<!--*****--><me>\begin{aligned}[t]
		                  3x(x + 1) \amp = 2x + 2\amp\amp \blert{\text{Apply the distributive law to the left side.}}\\
		                  3x^2 + 3x \amp = 2x + 2\amp\amp \blert{\text{Subtract }2x + 2 \text{ from both sides.}}\\
		                  3x^2 + x - 2 \amp = 0
		                  \end{aligned}</me><!--*****-->
	Next, we factor the left side to obtain
		<me>(3x - 2)(x + 1) = 0</me>
	We then apply the zero-factor principle by setting each factor equal to zero.
		<me>3x - 2 =0 ~~\text{ or }~~ x + 1 = 0</me>
	Finally, we solve each equation to find
		<me>x = \frac{2}{3} ~~\text{ or }~~ x = -1</me>
	The solutions are <m>\dfrac{2}{3}</m> and <m>-1</m>.</p></solution></example>

<warning><p>When we apply the zero-factor principle, one side of the equation <em>must be zero</em>. For example, to solve the equation
	<me>(x - 2)(x - 4) = 15</me>
it is incorrect to set each factor equal to <m>15</m>! (There are many ways that the product of two numbers can equal <m>15</m>; it is not necessary that one of the numbers be <m>15</m>.) We must first simplify the left side and write the equation in standard form. (The correct solutions are <m>7</m> and <m>-1</m>; check that you can find these solutions.)</p></warning>

<p>We summarize the factoring method for solving quadratic equations as follows.</p>

<assemblage><title>To Solve a Quadratic Equation by Factoring</title>

        <li>Write the equation in standard form.</li>
        <li>Factor the left side of the equation.</li>
        <li>Apply the zero-factor principle: Set each factor equal to zero.</li>
        <li>Solve each equation. There are two solutions (which may be equal).</li>

            <p>After rewriting the equation in standard form and then factoring, we find <m>t=-3</m> and <m>t=6</m>.</p>

</exercise>

<p>We can use factoring to solve the equation from <xref ref="investigation-height-of-baseball" text="type-global"/>.</p>

<example xml:id="example-height-of-baseball"><statement><p>The height, <m>h</m>, of a baseball <m>t</m> seconds after being hit is given by
		<me>h = -16t^2 + 64t + 4</me>
When will the baseball reach a height of <m>64</m> feet?</p></statement>

<solution><p>We substitute <m>64</m> for <m>h</m> in the formula, and solve for <m>t</m>.
		<!--*****--><me>\begin{aligned}[t]
		                  64 = -16t^2 + 64t \amp + 4\amp\amp \blert{\text{Write the equation in standard form.}}\\
		                  16t^2 - 64t + 60 \amp= 0\amp\amp \blert{\text{Factor 4 from the left side.}}\\
		                  4(4t^2 - 16t + 15) \amp= 0\amp\amp \blert{\text{Factor the quadratic expression.}}\\
		                  4(2t - 3)(2t - 5) \amp= 0\amp\amp \blert{\text{Set each variable factor equal to zero.}}\\
		                  2t - 3 =0 ~~\text{ or }~~ 2t - 5 \amp= 0\amp\amp \blert{\text{Solve each equation.}}\\
		                  t = \frac{3}{2}  ~~\text{ or }~~  t \amp = \frac{5}{2}
		                  \end{aligned}</me><!--*****-->
There are two solutions to the quadratic equation. At <m>t = \dfrac{3}{2}</m> seconds, the ball reaches a height of <m>64</m> feet on the way up, and at <m>t = \dfrac{5}{2}</m> seconds, the ball is <m>64</m> feet high on its way down. </p>
	<image width="40%" source="images/fig-height-of-baseball"><description>height of baseball</description></image>
</solution></example>

<p>In the solution to <xref ref="example-height-of-baseball" text="type-global"/>, the factor <m>4</m> does not affect the solutions of the equation at all. You can understand why this is true by looking at some graphs. First, check that the two equations
	<me>x^2 - 4x + 3 = 0 ~~\text{ and }~~ 4(x^2 - 4x + 3) = 0</me>
have the same solutions, <m>x = 1</m> and <m>x = 3</m>. Then use your graphing calculator to graph the equation
	<me>Y_1 = X^2 - 4X + 3</me>
in the window
	    <me>\begin{aligned}[t]
            \text{Xmin} \amp = -2 \amp\amp \text{Xmax} = 8\\
            \text{Ymin} \amp = -5 \amp\amp \text{Ymax} = 10
            \end{aligned}</me>
Notice that when <m>y = 0</m>, <m>x = 3</m> or <m>x = 1</m>. These two points are the <m>x</m>-intercepts of the graph. In the same window, now graph
       <me>Y_2 = 4(X^2 - 4X + 3)</me>
This graph has the same <m>x</m>-values when <m>y = 0</m>. The factor of <m>4</m> stretches the graph vertically but does not change the location of the <m>x</m>-intercepts.</p>

<p>Here is another example of how quadratic equations arise in applications.</p>

<subsection><title>Solutions of Quadratic Equations</title>

<p>We have seen that the solutions of the quadratic equation
	<me>a(x - r_1)(x - r_2) = 0</me>
are <m>r_1</m> and <m>r_2</m>. Thus, if we know the two solutions of a quadratic equation, we can work backward and reconstruct the equation, starting from its factored form. We can then write the equation in standard form by multiplying together the factors.</p>

<example xml:id="example-quadratic-equation-from-solutions"><statement><p>Find a quadratic equation whose solutions are <m>\dfrac{1}{2}</m> and <m>-3</m>.</p></statement>

<solution><p>The quadratic equation is 
		<!--*****--><me>\begin{aligned}[t]
		                  \left(x-\frac{1}{2}\right)\left[x-(-3)\right] \amp= 0\\
		                  \left(x-\frac{1}{2}\right)(x + 3) \amp = 0
		                  \end{aligned}</me><!--*****-->
To write the equation in standard form, we multiply the factors together.
		<me>x^2 + \frac{5}{2}x - \frac{3}{2}= 0</me>
We can also find an equation with integer coefficients if we clear the equation of fractions. Multiply both sides by <m>2</m>:
		<!--*****--><me>\begin{aligned}[t]
		                  2\left(x^2 + \frac{5}{2}x - \frac{3}{2}\right)\amp= 2(0)\\
		                  2x^2 + 5x - 3 \amp = 0
		                  \end{aligned}</me><!--*****-->
You can check that the solutions of this last equation are in fact <m>\dfrac{1}{2}</m> and <m>-3</m>. Multiplying both sides of an equation by a constant factor does not change its solutions.</p></solution></example>

<solution><p><m>3x^2 + 13x - 10 = 0</m></p></solution></exercise>

<note><p>A quadratic equation in one variable always has two solutions. However, in some cases, the solutions may be equal. For example, the equation
	<m>x^2 - 2x + 1 = 0</m>
can be solved by factoring as follows:
	<!--*****--><me>\begin{aligned}[t]
	                   (x - 1)(x - 1) \amp = 0\amp\amp \blert{\text{Apply the zero-factor principle.}}\\
	                   x - 1 =0 ~~\text{ or } ~~ x - 1 \amp= 0
	                   \end{aligned}</me><!--*****-->
Both of these equations have solution <m>1</m>. We say that <m>1</m> is a solution of <term>multiplicity</term><idx>multiplicity</idx> two, meaning that it occurs twice as a solution of the quadratic equation.</p></note>

<subsection><title>Equations Quadratic in Form</title>

<p>The equation <me>x^6 - 4x^3 - 5 = 0</me> is not quadratic, but if we make the substitution <m>u = x^3</m>, the equation becomes <me>u^2 - 4u - 5 = 0</me> An equation is called <term>quadratic in form</term><idx>quadratic in form</idx> if we can use a substitution to write it as <me>au^2 + bu + c = 0</me> where <m>u</m> stands for an algebraic expression. Such equations can be solved by the same techniques we use to solve quadratic equations.</p>

<example xml:id="example-quadratic-in-form"><statement><p>Use the substitution <m>u = x^3</m> to solve the equation <me>x^6 - 4x^3 - 5 = 0</me></p></statement>

<solution><p>We set <m>u = x^3</m>, so that <m>u^2 = \left(x^3\right)^2 = x^6</m>. The original equation then becomes a quadratic equation in the variable <m>u</m>, which we can solve by factoring.
		<!--*****--><me>\begin{aligned}[t]

		                  u \amp = -1 ~~ \text{  or }~~ u = 5
		                  \end{aligned}</me><!--*****-->
Finally, we replace <m>u</m> by <m>x^3</m> and solve for <m>x</m>.
		<!--*****--><me>\begin{aligned}[t]
		                  x^3 \amp = -1 ~~~~~~~\text{ or } \amp x^3 \amp= 5\amp\amp \blert{\text{Take cube roots.}}\\

You can verify that the solutions of the original equation are <m>-1</m> and <m>\sqrt[3]{5}</m>.</p></solution></example>
