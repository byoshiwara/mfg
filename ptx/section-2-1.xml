<introduction><p>In Chapter 1, we considered models described by linear functions. In this chapter, we begin our study of nonlinear models.</p>
</introduction>

<subsection><title>Solving Nonlinear Equations</title> 

<p>When studying nonlinear models, we will need to solve nonlinear equations. For example, in <xref ref="investigation-Perimeter-and-Area" text="type-hybrid"/> we used a graph to solve the quadratic equation <me>18x - x^2 = 80</me></p>
<p>Here is another example. The figure shows a table and a graph for the function <m>y = 2x^2 - 5</m>.</p>

<p> You can see that there are two points on the graph for each <m>y</m>-value greater than <m>-5</m>. For example, the two points with <m>y</m>-coordinate <m>7</m> are shown. To solve the equation 
    <me>2x^2 - 5 = 7</me> 
we need only find the <m>x</m>-coordinates of these points. From the graph, the solutions appear to be about <m>2.5</m> and <m>-2.5</m>.</p>

<p>How can we solve this equation algebraically? The opposite operation for squaring a number is taking a square root. So we can undo the operation of squaring by extracting square roots. We first solve for <m>x^2</m> to get
    <me>\begin{aligned}[t]
    2x^2 \amp= 12 \\
    x^2 \amp= 6\\
    \end{aligned}</me>
    and then take square roots to find
    <me>x = \pm\sqrt{6}</me></p>

<warning><p>Don't forget that every positive number has <em>two</em> square roots. The symbol <m>\blert{\pm}</m> (read “plus or minus”) is a shorthand notation used to indicate both square roots of <m>6</m>.</p>
</warning>
 
 <p>The exact solutions are thus <m>\sqrt{6}</m> and <m>-\sqrt{6}</m>. We can also find decimal <em>approximations</em> for the solutions using a calculator. Rounded to two decimal places, the approximate solutions are <m>2.45</m> and <m>-2.45</m>.</p>

<p>In general, we can solve equations of the form <m>~ax^2 + c = 0~</m> by isolating <m>x^2</m> on one side of the equation and then taking the square root of each side. This method for solving equations is called <term>extraction of roots</term><idx>extraction of roots</idx>.</p>

<assemblage><title>Extraction of Roots</title>
<p>To solve the equation
    <me>ax^2 + c = 0</me>
    <ol>

<subsection><title>Solving Formulas</title>

<p>We can use extraction of roots to solve many formulas involving the square of the variable.</p>

<example xml:id="example-volume-cone"><statement><p>The formula 
    <me>V = \dfrac{1}{3} \pi r^2h</me> 
gives the volume of a cone in terms of its height and radius. Solve the formula for <m>r</m> in terms of <m>V</m> and <m>h</m>.</p></statement>

<solution><p>Because the variable we want is squared, we use extraction of roots. First, we multiply both sides by <m>3</m> to clear the fraction.
    <me>
        \begin{aligned}[t]
        \alert{3}V \amp = \alert{3}\left(\frac{1}{3} \pi r^2h\right)\\
        3V \amp = \pi r^2h \amp\amp \blert{\text{Divide both sides by } \pi h.}\\
        \frac{3V}{\pi h}\amp= r^2 \amp\amp \blert{\text{Take square roots.}}\\
        \pm\sqrt{\dfrac{3V}{\pi h}}\amp= r
        \end{aligned}
    </me>
    Because the radius of a cone must be a positive number, we use only the positive square root: 
    <m>~~r = \sqrt{\dfrac{3V}{\pi h}}</m>.</p></solution></example>

<subsection><title>More Extraction of Roots</title>

<p>Equations of the form
    <me>\blert{a(px + q)^2 + r = 0}</me>
    can also be solved by extraction of roots after isolating the squared expression, <m>(px + q)^2</m>.</p>

<example xml:id="example-extracting-roots"><statement><p>Solve the equation <m>~3(x - 2)^2 = 48</m></p></statement>

<solution><p>
    First, we isolate the perfect square, <m>(x - 2)^2</m>.
    <me>
        \begin{aligned}[t]
        3(x - 2)^2 \amp = 48 \amp\amp\blert{\text{Divide both sides by }3.}\\
        (x - 2)^2 \amp = 16 \amp\amp\blert{\text{Take the square root of each side.}}\\
        x - 2 \amp = \pm\sqrt{16} = \pm 4
        \end{aligned}
    </me>
     This gives us two equations for <m>x</m>, 
    <me>
        \begin{aligned}[t]
        x - 2 \amp =4 \amp\amp \text{or }\amp x - 2 \amp =-4\amp\amp\blert{\text {Solve each equation.}}\\
        x \amp=6 \amp\amp \text{or }\amp x \amp =-2

<subsection xml:id="CompAnn"><title>Compound Interest and Inflation</title>

<p>Many savings institutions offer accounts on which the interest is <em>compounded annually</em>. At the end of each year, the interest earned is added to the principal, and the interest for the next year is computed on this larger sum of money.</p>

<assemblage><title>Compound Interest</title>
<p>If interest is compounded annually for <m>n</m> years, the amount, <m>A</m>, of money in an account is given by
    <me>A = P(1 + r)^n</me>
    where <m>P</m> is the principal and <m>r</m> is the interest rate, expressed as a decimal fraction.</p>
</assemblage>

<example><statement>
<p>Carmella invests $3000 in an account that pays an interest rate, <m>r</m>, compounded annually.</p>
<p><ol marker="a.">
        <li>Write an expression for the amount of money in Carmella’s account after two years.</li>
        <li>What interest rate would be necessary for Carmella's account to grow to $3500 in two years?</li>
    </ol></p></statement>

<solution><p><ol marker="a.">
    <li>We use the formula above with <m>P = 3000</m> and <m>n = 2</m>. Carmella’s account balance will be
            <me>A = 3000(1 + r)^2</me></li>
    <li>We substitute <m>3500</m> for <m>A</m> in the equation.
        <me>\alert{3500} = 3000(1 + r)^2</me>
    We can solve this equation in <m>r</m> by extraction of roots. First, we isolate the perfect square.
        <me>\begin{aligned}[t]
            3500 \amp = 3000(1 + r )^2 \amp\amp \blert{\text{Divide both sides by 3000.}} \\
        1.1\overline{6} \amp = (1 + r )^2 \amp\amp \blert{\text{Take the square root of both sides.}} \\
        \end{aligned}</me>
    This give us two equations to solve.
        <md><mrow>\pm 1.0801 \amp\approx 1 + r \amp\amp \blert{\text{Subtract 1 from both sides.}}</mrow>
            <mrow>r \approx 0.0801   \text{  or  } r \amp \approx -2.0801</mrow></md>
    Because the interest rate must be a positive number, we discard the negative solution. Carmella needs an account with interest rate <m>r \approx 0.0801</m>, or just over 8%, to achieve an account balance of $3500 in two years.</li>

<p>The formula for compound interest also applies to the effects of inflation. For instance, if there is a steady inflation rate of 4% per year, in two years an item that now costs $100 will cost
    <me>\begin{aligned}[t]
        A \amp= P(1 + r)^2\\
        \amp = 100(1 + 0.04)^2 = \$108.16

<p>Because squaring and taking square roots are opposite operations, we can solve the equation
    <me>\sqrt{x} = 8.2</me>
by squaring both sides to get
    <!--*****--><me>\begin{aligned}[t]
    (\sqrt{x})^2 \amp= 8.2^2 \\
    x \amp = 67.24
    \end{aligned}</me><!--*****-->
Similarly, we can solve
    <me>x^3 = 258</me>
by taking the cube root of both sides, because cubing and taking cube roots are opposite operations. Rounding to three places, we find 
    <me>\begin{aligned}[t]
    \sqrt[3]{x^3}\amp=258\\
    x \amp \approx 6.366

<p>The notion of undoing operations can help us solve a variety of simple nonlinear equations. The operation of taking a reciprocal is its own opposite, so we solve the equation
    <me>\frac{1}{x} = 50</me>
by taking the reciprocal of both sides to get
    <me>x = \frac{1}{50}= 0.02</me></p>

<example xml:id="example-nonlinear-equation"><statement><p>Solve <m>~~\dfrac{3}{x - 2}= 4</m></p></statement>

<solution><p>We begin by taking the reciprocal of both sides of the equation to get
    <me>\frac{x - 2}{3}= \frac{1}{4}</me>
    We continue to undo the operations in reverse order. First, we multiply both sides by <m>3</m>.
    <me>\begin{aligned}[t]
    x - 2 \amp = \frac{3}{4} \amp\amp \blert{\text{Add 2 to both sides.}}\\
    x \amp = 2 + \frac{3}{4}= \frac{11}{4} \amp\amp \blert{\tfrac{2}{1}+ \tfrac{3}{4}=\tfrac{8}{4}+\tfrac{3}{4}=\tfrac{11}{4}}\\

<technology><title>Using the Intersect Feature</title>
    <p>We can use the <em>intersect</em> feature on a graphing calculator to solve equations.</p>
</technology>

<example xml:id="example-GC-nonlinear-equation">
<statement><p>Use a graphing calculator to solve <m>~~\dfrac{3}{x -2}= 4</m></p></statement>

<solution><p>We would like to find the points on the graph of <m>~~y = \dfrac{3}{x -2}~~</m> that have <m>y</m>-coordinate equal to <m>4</m>. We graph the two functions
    <me>\begin{aligned}[t]
    Y_1 \amp = 3/(X - 2)  \\
    Y_2 \amp = 4
    \end{aligned}</me>
in the window
    <me>\begin{aligned}[t]
    \text{Xmin} \amp = -9.4 \amp\amp \text{Xmax} = 9.4\\
    \text{Ymin} \amp = -10 \amp\amp \text{Ymax} = 10
    \end{aligned}</me>
The point where the two graphs intersect locates the solution of the equation. If we trace along the graph of <m>Y_1</m>, the closest we can get to the intersection point is <m>(2.8, 3.75)</m>, as shown in figure (a). We get a better approximation using the <em>intersect</em> feature.</p>
    <sidebyside  width="100%"><image source="images/fig-GC-nonlinear"><description>GC displays</description></image></sidebyside>
<p>Use the arrow keys to position the Trace bug as close to the intersection point as you can. Then press <kbd>2nd</kbd> <kbd>TRACE</kbd> to see the Calculate menu. Press <m>5</m> for intersect; then respond to each of the calculator's questions, <em>First curve?</em>, <em>Second curve?</em>, and <em>Guess?</em> by pressing <kbd>ENTER</kbd>. The calculator will then display the intersection point, <m>x = 2.75</m>, <m>y = 4</m>, as shown in figure (b). The solution of the original equation is <m>x = 2.75</m>.</p></solution>
